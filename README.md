--Python Portfolio Project #4--
## Turn-Based RPG Battle System ##

This project holds a small-scale turn-based RPG battle system inspired by one of my favorite RPG classics of all time--Final Fantasy I. 

Instead of simply playing games like this, I thought it would be fun to push my programming skills to the next level and create it myself. 

// Game Features 
1. Character Naming
2. Enemy Encounter
3. Turn-based Battle
4. Exp/Leveling System
5. Gold System

In a truly full-scale project, I would add a full-scale world map, item system, random enemy encounters upon movement between zones, and dialogue/main quest progression through interactions with object and NPCs, to name a few things.


// Collaborators
I am not seeking collaborators for this project at this current moment. For now, feel free to fork this repo and build upon it for yourself!
