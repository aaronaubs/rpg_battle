## Turn-Based RPG Battle System ##
--Python Portfolio Project #4--

This project holds a small-scale turn-based RPG battle system inspired by one of my favorite RPG classics of all time--Final Fantasy I. 

Instead of simply playing games like this, I thought it would be beneficial and enjoyable to push my programming skills to the next level and create it myself. 

// Game Features 
1. Party Member Naming
2. Traversable Region Map
3. Random Enemy Encounters
4. Turn-based Battle
5. Exp Accumulation and Level System
6. Gold Accumulation System

In a truly full-scale project, I would add a full-scale world map, fully built item system, and dialogue/main quest progression through interactions with objects and NPCs, to name a few things.


// Collaborators
I am not seeking collaborators for this project at this current moment. For now, feel free to fork this repo and build upon it for yourself!
